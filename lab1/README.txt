In my main method, I made 4 passenger objects which have are then declared by stating if it's 
a member or a nonmember. The passenger class has child/parent relationship with the member and nonmember.

A manager object is created where the object would call the methods that are made in the manager class.

This manager object calls the display and create methods where it make the list and displays whatever 
the user calls.
 
The bookSeat method which is called using the manager object is prints a ticket out. If you call the method to a point
where the capacity is zero, it won't print out the ticket.
